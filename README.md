# Java Data Structures

This project is a collection of core data structures implemented from scratch in Java. The goal is to deepen my understanding of these structures' internal logic and demonstrate proficiency with fundamental algorithms, memory management, and performance trade-offs.

Java's built-in data structures (e.g., HashMap, LinkedList, Stack, etc.) are not used â€” with the exception of ArrayList, which is used strictly for dynamic array support.

## Data Structures Implemented

### Arrays  
- Dynamic array implementation using ArrayList for internal resizing and capacity management.

### Linked Lists  
- Singly and doubly linked lists with support for insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

### Stacks  
- Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations with push, pop, and peek.

### Queues  
- Standard FIFO queues using both array-based and linked list-based structures.

### Hash Tables  
- Custom hash table with basic collision handling using chaining (linked lists).

### Heaps  
- Min-heap and max-heap using an array-based binary heap model.

### Binary Search Trees (BSTs)  
- Node-based tree structure supporting insert, delete, search, and all common traversals:  
  - In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order.

## Testing & Usage

- Each File has it's own static `main` method for testing.
